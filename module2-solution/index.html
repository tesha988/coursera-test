  					<p class="titl1">Football</p>
  					<p class="text"><b>Football</b> is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball with the foot to score a goal. Unqualified, the word football is understood to refer <i>to whichever form of football is the most popular in the regional context in which the word appears.</i> Sports commonly called 'football' in certain places include: association football (known as soccer in some countries); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian rules football; rugby football (either rugby league or rugby union); and Gaelic football. These different variations of football are known as football codes.</p>

 					<p class="titl2">Basketball</p>
 					<p class="text"><b>Basketball</b> is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and mounted at a height of 10 feet (3.048 m) to backboards at each end of the court.
					<i>A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket being defended by the opposition team during regular play.</i> A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. </p>

 					<p class="titl3">Boxing</p>
 					<p class="text"><b>Boxing</b> is a combat sport in which two people wearing protective gloves throw punches at each other for a predetermined set of time in a boxing ring.
					<i>Amateur boxing is both an Olympic and Commonwealth Games sport and is a common fixture in most international gamesâ€”it also has its own World Championships.</i> Boxing is supervised by a referee over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds. The result is decided when an opponent is deemed incapable to continue by a referee, is disqualified for breaking a rule, resigns by throwing in a towel, or is pronounced the winner or loser based on the judges' scorecards at the end of the contest.</p>
